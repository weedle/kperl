# kperl
Perl script to keep track of grep results, assorted tools

Basically my first perl script, that ended up getting kinda out of hand.
This script basically lets you grep recursively and highlights the results accordingly.
It gives you the following features:
- Save results to a file list, multiple file lists are supported, and can be saved/loaded as needed
- Search for a number of search terms at once, highlight each individually
- Search through a list of files
- Files to be appended to a list can be selected individually or by file type
- There's also a cat-like operator that highlights terms as the file scrolls by (at manual or automatic speed)
- Oh, there are also shortcuts to open files from certain lists in vim or w/e
- There are more, I can't remember them all atm. Feel free to message me for details/suggestions at hearke@outlook.com
